In this paper, the design, manufacturing, and control of a twin rotor system are studied. The pitch angle of the system is controlled using various methods.
We can precisely access the desired pitch angle of the system through two angle and angular velocity sensors. Three controllers, namely PID, state feedback, and fuzzy controllers, are designed and implemented for the system. 
In this system, achieving a fast rise time and minimal overshoot are our desired response specifications. It has been demonstrated that the PID controller exhibits an unacceptable overshoot, while the fuzzy controller has a very long rise time, albeit without overshoot. 
The transient response of the state feedback controller falls between that of the fuzzy controller and the PID controller. From the perspective of sinusoidal responses, the differences between them are not significant, even though the fuzzy controller has a slower response compared to the others.
