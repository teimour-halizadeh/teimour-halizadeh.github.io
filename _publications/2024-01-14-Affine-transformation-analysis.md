Search for the optimizer in computationally demanding model predictive control (MPC) setups can be facilitated by Cloud as a service provider in cyber-physical systems. This advantage introduces the risk that Cloud can obtain unauthorized access to the privacy-sensitive parameters of the system and cost function. To solve this issue, i.e., preventing Cloud from accessing the parameters while benefiting from Cloud computation, random affine transformations provide an exact yet light weight in computation solution. This research deals with analyzing privacy preserving properties of these transformations when they are adopted for MPC problems. We consider two common strategies for outsourcing the optimization required in MPC problems, namely separate and dense forms, and establish that random affine transformations utilized in these forms are vulnerable to side-knowledge from Cloud. Specifically, we prove that the privacy guarantees of these methods and their extensions for separate form are undermined when a mild side-knowledge about the problem in terms of structure of MPC cost function is available. In addition, while we prove that outsourcing the MPC problem in the dense form inherently leads to some degree of privacy for the system and cost function parameters, we also establish that affine transformations applied to this form are nevertheless prone to be undermined by a Cloud with mild side-knowledge. Numerical simulations confirm our results.
