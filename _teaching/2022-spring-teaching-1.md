I was a teaching assistant for the course Optimization for Engineering systems.
The course was a graduate course for the program ["Industrial Engineering and Management."](https://www.rug.nl/masters/industrial-engineering-and-management/?lang=en)

The lecturer was [Nima Monshizadeh](https://www.rug.nl/staff/n.monshizadeh/?lang=en).
